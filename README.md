# 1. DSS_Mask_RCNN
This is a traffic surveillance project for digital surveillance system course in NTUST, Taiwan. We use Google Colaboration to run this project, so the first thing you need is to setup your Google Colaboration and Google Drive Account.

# 2. Setting up your Google Drive Account
If this is your first time using Google Colab, I strongly advised you to read this excellent article below by Fuat in Medium.

That article will give you a nice basic to get used with Google Colab.

## 2.1. First make sure to download the needed data
The sources of this project are from https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN and https://www.dlology.com/blog/how-to-run-object-detection-and-segmentation-on-video-fast-for-free/ with a little modification.
 
 The test data are from NTUST Artificial Vision Lab.

## 2.2. Setup your Google Drive and Project Folder
First, download the .rar file which contain all the necessary data and weight for the Mask RCNN from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ie7pkzccEe0cSL4Oj42Thy8VTfTNlr-0 This file is a bit large because it contains ~1000 image used for constructing videos and testing the Mask RCNN.

After downloading the file, extract it and place it in your Google Drive, inside folder named Colab Notebooks. The Colab Notebooks folder are usually created by default when you signed up for Google Colab and set up your drive account for the first time.
